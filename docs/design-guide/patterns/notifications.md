# Notifications

Notifications should be relevant to the user and as minimally disruptive as possible. There are two major use cases for notifications: **Task Generated** notifications and **System Generated** notifications.

### Task Generated

Task generatied notifications are invoked in response to the user's interaction during a task. They should be place in the immediate area of the interaction where the user is working.

### System Generated

System generated notifications are invoked by the application or the underlying system infrastructure. These nnotifications provide feedback on the system state or state of a background-running process.
