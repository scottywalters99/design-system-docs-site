# Typography

Use typography deliberately to create clear hierarchies, organize information, and guide users through information and workflows.

[[TOC]]

## Tokens
Company uses type tokens to manage typography. Type tokens are pre-configured sets of typographic attributes such as font size, weight, and line-height that are calibrated for use with the Helvetica Neue typeface.
Layouts usually have several areas that require varying typographic hierarchies. Type Tokens also help to bridge the communication gap between design and development. The tokens allow the design assets to translate into coded solutions.

## Typeface

#### Backstory
The Helvetica® (Latin for Swiss) has the objective and functional style which was associated with Swiss typography in the 1950s and 1960s. The font is perfect for international correspondence: no ornament, no emotion, just clear presentation of information.

## Type Scale

This Type Scale was created to conform to the 4px grid layout principal in the design guidelines. It is a robust scale that offers solutions for simple to complex hierarchies in layouts and components. The scale is calculated from a 14px (1rem) base.

## Styles

##### Weight

Font weight is used to differentiate content hierarchy. A bold font-weight will always have more emphasis than a lighter weight font of the same size.
Use a bold weight for section headers and table headers. The page header should use a regular weight but will be larger than any other text on the page.

##### Italic

The italic style should only be used to emphasize certain words in sentences, captions, or labels (For example, clinical terms, technical terms, legal terms, machines, devices, etc.).

## Color

To achieve balance and harmony in our interface designs - across all digital products at Company, deliberate use of color is paramount. Follow the guidelines to ensure the best usability outcomes and to meet the accessibility standards for sight-impaired users. To achieve text accessibility to all users designers focus on contrast. This is scored by evaluating the size and color of the text against the background color. For more on how the contrast score is calculated see the [WCAG AA Standards](//www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html) success criterion. For a more in-depth understanding of accessibility standards, see the Accessibility section of the Design System.
